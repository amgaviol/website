    <td>Hunger Games</td>
    <td>9/10</td>
    <td>I loved the movies and the book was even better. I watched the movies before I read the book, but I think it made reading it 10x better because I now had the visual of what the characters and settings look like, which made pulled me even deeper. One of the greatest dystopian fiction of all time, or at least one of the best-selling ones. A literature masterpiece? Hardly. One of the most entertaining ever? Quite possibly! Astounding world building and character development. Not a profound reading at all, but a plot perfectly balanced, fast paced and action packed. The love triangle was a weird and unnecessary but other aspects made up for it. HIGHLY RECCOMEND</td>

    <td>The Seven Husands of Evelyn Hugo</td>
    <td>10/10</td>
    <td><i>“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”</i> This book is phenomenal. This book is spectacular. This book is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this book. It's a pure 5 star for me. I'm irrevocably astonished and astounded. I want to hug and kiss this book till I bleed. I couldn't leave it down. I just couldn't. I would be up reading and crying at 3am. I'm not really a fan of historical fiction but this book is a gamechanger. This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy, nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything, the friendships, the love stories. Evelyn's life is so engaging and complicated, you can't get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? </td>

    <td>Maze Runner</td>
    <td>6.8/10</td>
    <td>I love dystopian novels. The plot for this one was interesting and I liked it. However, it had too many unlikeable characters that stopped me from <i>falling in love</i> with it. The main character, Thomas, was annoying. Rather than allowing his readers to feel what Thomas feels, Dashner chooses to tell. We are told many times how "frustrated" and "confused" Thomas is, but we can't identify with him. Some of the supporting characters, such as Minho and Newt, could be interesting, but they remain secondary to Thomas. In addition, I was frustrated with the character Teresa. Teresa is the only female main character; instead of making her an intriguing, powerful female, she is christened with flimsy adjectives such as "very pretty" and "smart", becoming yet another 1-dimensional character. I realize that this is a plot-driven story and not a character-driven one, but I would hope that the characters would at least be appealing to the reader.</td>

    <td>Ugly Love</td>
    <td>7/10</td>
    <td>Romance is my favourite genre. I'm a sucker for it. Howver, this book was not my favourite. Some spoilers must be named to get my point across. The story centers around our main guy, Miles, and his best friend's sister (our main gal). Miles has a secretive past and does not like to talk about it. Now, He is toxic to our main girl, which is one of the reasons i'm not a fan. I need a loveable main guy that I can swoon over and hes not it. Basically, you know what, i'm gonna be straight to the point: MILES SEEMED MORE IN LOVE WITH RACHEL. or at least he will never love anyone the way he loved Rachel because it was that intense. now, now. lemme explain. The problem is, almost all of Miles' pov in this book is about the past and most of these past chapters are of him falling so deeply and passionately in love with Rachel that he turns into fucking ✨ s h a k e s p e a r e ✨ he is <strong>NEVER</strong> as sweet to our main girl (<strong>the girl he ends up with btw</strong>) as he is to the other one. Maybe that was the point of the story, that you can't escape or erase the past blah blah. I, however, did not like it.</td>

    <td>It Ends With Us</td>
    <td>9/10</td>
    <td>I loved and enjoyed this book. It was one of the most powerful books and one of the most raw, honest, inspiring, and profoundly beautiful stories I've ever read. It wasn’t anything like what I expected, but it delivered so much more than I ever hoped for. This is the kind of book that I want to give to every woman and just be like… READ THIS BOOK. NOW. Come to think of it, all the men should read it too. EVERYONE should read this book. Absolutely everyone. It's a story of unshakable love and finding the strength to make the right choice in the hardest situation. I honestly don't think I've ever been prouder of a heroine. A lot of tears came out of me from this one. This book is unputdownable. You'll notice as you read that there are no good stopping points. None at all. I began reading it late at night and every time I tried to put it down to go to sleep, I just had to get back up and keep reading because I couldn't stop thinking about it. I didn't finish until almost 5AM but my gosh was it ever worth it! Of all the heroines I've ever read, Lily was most certainly one of the ones I admired the most. I knew loved her from the first few pages, but having finished the book, I truly couldn't be prouder of her. Her strength and conviction over the course of this story made her into a heroine I'd want every girl and woman to read about and look up to. She was so real and vulnerable as we all are, but the strength with which she took control of her life was admirable on such a deep level. I just wanted to hug her and cheer. I don't think I've been this proud of a fictional character before. There's an incredibly powerful message in this book that is very subtly woven in from the start. It begins in the first chapter, but you don't yet realize how significant each of these moments truly are... and as you read more, these pieces of the story come together forming a scenario that gives such a raw, honest portrayal of an incredibly relevant issue. I'm not mentioning it on purpose because I don't want you to expect it. The fact that it's unexpected for you as the reader is very important because it's also unexpected for the heroine. As she begins to realize what kind of situation she's in, so do you. And this realization very much allows you to experience her journey with her. </td>

    <td>The One Where They Both Die at the End</td>
    <td>8.2/10</td>
    <td>The concept behind this book is fantastic - in an alternate world, a company called Death-Cast calls people to tell them when their last day has arrived so they can say their goodbyes, live in the moment, and tie up any loose ends. Of course, knowing you are going to die is also horrifying, especially if you feel you haven't lived your life to the full. An app called Last Friend brings together those who are dying and enables them to find someone to enjoy their last day with. It sounded like it should be an extremely powerful read, and yet I found that They Both Die at the End had far less of an emotional impact than More Happy Than Not and History Is All You Left Me. It's my least favourite Silvera book to date.</td>

    <td>We Were Liars</td>
    <td>6.5/10</td>
    <td>This book has almost no plot. It is full of odd sentence structures and purple prose. The entire book is about a poor-little-rich-girl living with a poor-little-rich-family with the kind of ending that makes you go <strong> "WHAT THE ACTUAL KIND OF M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN IS THIS?!"</strong>It's not terrible. But there's almost no plot at all. The "Liars" are more "Talkers," and they have almost no relevant role in the book because this book is about a pretentious girl with nothing but #whitegirlproblems and #richpeopleproblems. The aforementioned "Liars" don't do anything in this book, they're not witty, they're not cute, they don't give off the sense of closeness and kinship that you get from growing up with someone their entire life. Hell, they're nowhere near Dead Poets Society kind of interesting.</td>

    <td>The Fault in Our Stars</td>
    <td>7.5/10</td>
    <td>Hazel's days are numbered thanks to her crap lungs. She was able to buy a few years more, thanks to a miracle, but she isn't fooling herself. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel's story is about to be completely rewritten. I don't think I've ever cried so much, laughed so much, just over all enjoyed a book as much as I have while reading The Fault in Our Stars. Everything that goes on is serious, heartbreaking and eye opening but John Green does an amazing job at, literally, making you laugh out loud. Even when you're suffering. Hazel... what a breathe of fresh air her character was. She was real and I loved her no bullshit attitude. She wasn't fooling herself, and John Green didn't make her out to be ecstatic with the world or her situation. She wasn't bitchy or depressing, but it wasn't like she was perfectly fine to sit idly and watch the time tick by. Get your tissues ready.

    <td>Heartstopper</td>
    <td>10/10</td>
    <td>Was this absolutely adorable? YES. Do I need to immediately read them all? Also yes. Heartstopper by Alice Oseman is such a sweet and lovely graphic novel of two boys on the cusp of romance that will certainly give you all the feels and feel relatable for anyone who has ever loved. Seriously, reading this I was suddenly 16 again going through the bittersweet maelstrom of emotions of a first big crush and all the swirling feelings of euphoria and anxiety that come with it. This book is absolutely perfect, well aside from only being the first part of a larger series but still. Oseman perfectly captures chaotic, romantic emotion in such simple yet effective artistic storytelling that gave me chills and had me devouring the whole graphic novel in a single, blissful sitting. The art is lovely too. It is fairly simple yet manages to convey a lot of action and emotion. There are multiple small frames of each page and Oseman uses the white space as well as frame size and things like leaves in the margins to convey passage of time, anxieties, action and current emotions in a really productive way. This is a work of art where all the individual aspects come together to create a feeling in unique and creative ways.</td>

      <td>A Good Girl's Guide to Murder</td>
      <td>8.5/10</td>
      <td>Lets add a little mystery to these book reviews. Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words! The plot pulls you in and keeps you intrigued throughout the whole book, unlike other mystery books. It keeps you questioning on what will happen next and you find yourself trying to solve the mystery along with our heroine, Pippa.</td>

     <td>Verity</td>
    <td>8/10</td>
    <td>An unfinished autobiography. As she reads, her fear grows. Lowen begins to dig into dark truths about the family and the deaths of their twin daughters. At the same time, she finds herself falling for Jeremy and wondering if perhaps she should reveal the truth to him. I don't want to say too much, but I thought it was excellent. Hoover expertly leads us on a winding trail of lies and manipulation. As the story is essentially Hoover - an author - writing about an author reading about another author, there's this constant sense that someone is lying to you-- but who is it? Now, that's not so easy to tell.</td>
